# SimpleObjLog

Instead of just plain text logs should countain data. Best would be a log saves objects of different types. In general graph obj should be prefered, that can be linked freely. Fix links are a limitation. Types should share common cols in front, and may have individual cols behind.

Save in standard formats instaead proprietary log file format: just as csv, json, yaml or Db table. This makes it easy to process data with standard tools.
